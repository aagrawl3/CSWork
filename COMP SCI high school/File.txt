Having gone through with the organization of the government, I shall
now proceed to examine more particularly those clauses which respect its powers. I 
shall begin with those articles and stipulations which are necessary for accurately 
ascertaining the extent of powers, and what is given, and for guarding, limiting, and 
restraining them in their exercise. We often find, these articles and stipulations placed
in bills of rights; but they may as well be incorporated in the body of the constitution, 
as selected and placed by themselves. The constitution, or whole social compact, is but
one instrument, no more or less, than a certain number of articles or stipulations agreed 
to by the people, whether it consists of articles, sections, chapters, bills of rights, or
parts of any other denomination, cannot be material.
